=Why is this plugin better than the alternatives?=
* It was built by a FFL, actively used by that FFL. I know what the industry needs, especially those first starting out with smaller budgets.
* The data services are built on state-of-the-art cloud-based technologies hosted on Amazon Web Services. This basically means that downtime will be minimal, and performance will be consistent.
